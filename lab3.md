**Lab 3**

Part 1  
* A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)  
```
    @Test
  public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,2,1}, input1);
  }
```
* An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
  ```
    @Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
	}
  ```  
* The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)  
  Failure-inducing input with an input that doesn't induce a failure
