1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
  * *cd*: Running this command doesn't do anything because there is no argument. If there was a directory, runnning the command "CD" alone would bring you to 
        like a home screen on a phone. If there was an argument, the "CD" command changes the directory you are in. The output isn't an error because we weren't
        in a directory in the first place, so nothing happens, no matter how many times you run the command.
  * *ls*: When I ran this command, it displayed "Lecture1" the file name.
