1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
  * `cd`: Running this command doesn't do anything because there is no argument. If there was a directory, runnning the command `cd` alone would bring you to 
        like a home screen on a phone. If there was an argument, the `cd` command changes the directory you are in. The output isn't an error because we weren't
        in a directory in the first place, so nothing happens, no matter how many times you run the command.
  * `ls`: When running this command, it displayed "lecture1" the file name. This command stands for "list files" and does exactly that. Since we aren't in a directory, "lecture1" was outputted. If we were in a directory, for example in "lecture1" it would then output all the files within the directory. This would not be an error because we are getting an output.
  *  `cat`: In this case, there is no working directory when I ran this command. Usually the command `cat` is suppose to print out the contents of the argument, if the argument is valid. Without an argument, the command continues attempting to execute the command until you manually end it.
    
2. Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
  * `cd lecture1`: When running this command, I noticed that the promt changed. Now it includes the working directory the terminal is in. The purpose of the `cd` command is the change the directory. Running the command with "lecture1" as the argument set the main working directory to "lecture1". This would not be an error because the command succesfully executed. We can see this by the change in the prompt and by running `pwd` which stands for "print working directory".
  *  `ls messages`:
